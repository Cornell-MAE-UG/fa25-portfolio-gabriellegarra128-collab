My name is Gabrielle Garra and I am a senior in the College of Engineering at Cornell University pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Business Management, and beginning my M.Eng. in Aerospace Engineering in Spring 2026. I am deeply interested in spaceflight mechanics, aerospace design and analysis, and the systems that enable advanced space missions. This portfolio highlights selected work that reflects my technical growth, interdisciplinary background, and commitment to contributing to the future of the aerospace industry.
